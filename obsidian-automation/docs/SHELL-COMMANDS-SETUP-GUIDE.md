## Step 2: Configure Shell Commands

1. **Open Shell Commands Settings**

   ```
   - Make sure there are no extra spaces or line breaks

4. **Give it a Name (Optional but Recommended)**

   - Scroll back up to the command
   - Click the **▶️ (play/execute)** button next to your command
   - You should see a notification: "✅ Daily note updated"
   - Check your Daily note - it should be populated!

8. **Save Settings**
   - Click **"Save"** if there's a save button
   - Or just close settings (saves automatically)

## Step 3: Verify It Works

1. **Close Obsidian Completely**
   - `Cmd + Q` (Mac) or `Alt + F4` (Windows)
   - Don't just minimize - fully quit the app

2. **Reopen Obsidian**
   - Launch Obsidian again
   - Open your vault

3. **Check Daily Note**

     - 💰 Revenue Activities (populated)
     - 📊 Projects (populated)
     - 💡 Ideas & Notes (populated)

4. **Look for Success Notification**
   - When vault opens, you should see a brief notification
   - "✅ Daily note updated" or similar

## 🎯 What Happens Now

**Every time you open Obsidian:**
1. Shell Commands plugin runs automatically
2. Python script checks which ProjectX files exist
3. Determines current project phase
4. Populates daily note with relevant priorities
5. Updates revenue activities and project tasks
6. Only updates once per day (won't duplicate)

**The script is smart:**
- Detects your current project phase
- Suggests next actions based on progress
- Marks completed tasks with ✅
- Links to relevant files with [[wiki links]]

## 🔧 Optional Enhancements

### Add Manual Hotkey

If you want to trigger updates manually:

1. In Shell commands settings, find your command
2. Click **"Add hotkey"** or go to Hotkeys section
3. Search for "Update Daily Note"
4. Assign a hotkey (e.g., `Cmd + Shift + D`)
5. Now press your hotkey anytime to refresh the note

### Disable Auto-Update Temporarily

If you want to pause auto-updates:

1. Go to Shell commands settings
2. Find "Vault: After startup" toggle
3. Turn it OFF
4. Updates will stop until you turn it back on

### Run on Note Open

To update when you open the daily note (not just vault open):

1. In Shell commands settings
2. Enable **"File: After open"** event
3. Set file filter to: `Daily/*.md`

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Command not found" or "python3: command not found"

**Fix:** Find your Python path
```bash
# In Terminal, run:
which python3

# Copy the full path (e.g., /usr/local/bin/python3)
# Update command to use that path:
/usr/local/bin/python3 /Users/username/Documents/ObsidianVault/.scripts/update_daily_note.py
```

### No notification appears

**Check:**
1. Settings → Shell commands → Your command
2. Make sure "Execute in background" is ON
3. Set "Output channel" to "Notification"

### Daily note not updating

**Debug:**
1. Test command manually (click ▶️ button)
2. Check for error messages
3. Verify daily note exists in `Daily/` folder
4. Check state file:
   ```bash
   cat /Users/username/Documents/ObsidianVault/.scripts/daily_note_state.json
   ```

### Updates happen twice

**Fix:** Only one trigger should be enabled
- Either "Vault: After startup" OR
- "File: After open"
- Not both (unless you want both)

### Permission denied

**Fix:** Make script executable
```bash
chmod +x /Users/username/Documents/ObsidianVault/.scripts/update_daily_note.py
```

## 📱 Mobile Setup (iOS/Android)

**Note:** Shell commands don't work on mobile Obsidian

**Alternatives for mobile:**
- Use Templater plugin for mobile
- Or just update notes on desktop
- Mobile syncs via iCloud/Dropbox

---

## 🎨 Customization

### Change What Gets Populated

Edit the Python script:
```bash
# Open in your editor:
code /Users/username/Documents/ObsidianVault/.scripts/update_daily_note.py

# Or use nano:
nano /Users/username/Documents/ObsidianVault/.scripts/update_daily_note.py
```

**Key functions to customize:**
- `get_project_priorities()` - Top 3 priorities
- `get_revenue_activities()` - Revenue tasks
- `get_project_tasks()` - Project checklist

### Add More Projects

Currently tracks:
- ProjectX/ProjectData
- LifeHub

To add ClientProject or other projects, edit `get_project_tasks()` function.

---

## 📊 Monitoring

### Check Last Update

```bash
cat /Users/username/Documents/ObsidianVault/.scripts/daily_note_state.json
```

Shows:
- Last update date
- Previous priorities
- Update status

### Force Fresh Update

```bash
# Delete state file to force update:
rm /Users/username/Documents/ObsidianVault/.scripts/daily_note_state.json

# Then reopen Obsidian
```
